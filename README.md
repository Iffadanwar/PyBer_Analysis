The purpose of analysing the city_data and ride_data was to determine key metrics that allows a ride sharing company run by V. Isualize to compare rural, suburban, and urban cities with eachother. The assingmentemt specifically directs us to find and ploace in a summary date frame the following metrics:
  - Total Rides in the given data set
  - Total drivers and drivers per region type
  - Total fares per region type
  - Average fares per ride
  - Average fare per driver
The assingment also asks us to find the total weekly fares for each region type in the form of a line graph. We are also expected to undrstand the data and explain it.
